# Understanding the Platform

**Control Markets** is a suite of tools designed to automate creative and repetitive tasks using intelligent workflows.

The centerpiece of the platform is the **Creative FlowBoard**. Understanding how these flows work is essential for mastering the tool.

## Platform Sections

The platform is organized into several key sections (some in Alpha/WIP stage):

*   **Home**: A summary of your recent activities and executed flows. *(WIP)*.
*   **Flows**: The heart of the system. This is where you access the **Creative FlowBoard** to design and run your processes.
*   **Agents**: Manage your AI personalities. You can define their traits and voices to use them in any flow.
*   **Tasks**: A library of pre-configured instructions and actions that agents can execute.
*   **Results**: A centralized history of your flows' outputs. You can also view them directly on the board via output nodes.
*   **Sources**: Manage the knowledge and context (texts, references) that you feed into your flows.
*   **Analysis**: Functionality for analyzing videos, extracting information, and gathering inspiration. *(WIP)*.
*   **Video Projects**: A tool for creating full AI-generated videos. *(WIP)*.

## General Operation

### Workspaces
Each user has their own execution space. However, Control Markets supports the creation of **Organizations**, allowing multiple users to collaborate in the same space, sharing flows, agents, and results.

### Creative FlowBoard
To get started, simply create a new flow in the Flows section.
*   **Adding Nodes**: At the top of the board, you'll find buttons to add the most common nodes. Clicking one will add it to the center of the board.
*   **Advanced Nodes**: There is a specific button to toggle the full library of available nodes.

### Node Types (Color Categories)
*   **🟢 Green (Input)**: Nodes that provide information or identity, such as Agents, Assets, and Sources.
*   **🟠 Orange (Processing)**: Nodes that perform actions, such as Tasks, Audio, and Video generation.
*   **🔵 Blue (Output)**: These are the results generated by processing nodes. They are not created manually but appear as a result of an execution.

## Connecting Nodes
The magic happens when you connect nodes. Simply drag the "handle" (connection point) of one node and drop it onto another's.

Nodes are intelligent and change their behavior based on their connections:
*   **Audio + Agent**: The audio node will generate content using the specific voice of the connected agent.
*   **Task + Agent**: The task doesn't just execute; it adopts the personality and tone of the agent. You can even chat directly with the agent about that specific task.
