# 🌐 Platform Overview

**Control Markets** is a visual orchestrator for agentic workflows. It combines the power of modern LLMs (Large Language Models) with a flexible node-based interface to automate marketing, content generation, and creative strategy.

## 🏗️ The Core Concept
The platform operates on a simple principle: **Connect specialized intelligence to your data sources and output results where they matter.**

Unlike standard chatbots that provide one-off answers, Control Markets allows you to build **reusable engines** that can be triggered repeatedly with new information.

## 🧩 The Three Pillars of the Flow
Everything on your canvas falls into one of these three categories:

1.  **📥 Inputs (The "Source")**: This is the data you feed into the system. It could be a CSV file, a PDF, a live Website link, or even just a block of text.
    *   **Agents**: Specialized personas with unique voices and expertise.
    *   **Sources**: Data sources (e.g., CSV, PDF, Website).
2.  **⚙️ Processes (The "Intelligence")**: This is where the magic happens. 
    *   **Tasks**: Specific instructions (prompts) on what to do with the input.
    *   **Generators**: Tools that turn text into video, images, or audio.
3.  **📤 Outputs (The "Channel")**: Where the result goes. A distribution channel (like TikTok or a Newsletter) or a Lead capture point.

## 🖼️ The Dual-Layer Interface
Control Markets uses a unique **Dual-Layer** approach to keep you focused:

*   **The Canvas (Orchestration)**: An infinite board where you design the "big picture" logic. You can see how data flows from left to right.
*   **The Detail Layer (Configuration)**: A draggable, deep-dive interface that opens when you select a node. This is where you write the actual prompts, configure API settings, or see the generated results in detail.

## 🎯 Who is this for?
*   **Creators**: To explode their productivity by automating scriptwriting and content research.
*   **Marketers**: To manage multiple niches and personas with consistent brand voices.
*   **Engineers**: To build and extend the platform with custom nodes and complex integrations.
