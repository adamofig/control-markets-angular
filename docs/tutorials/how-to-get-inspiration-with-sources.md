# Source Ideas for Viral TikTok Videos

To ensure the **Control Markets** platform generates content that truly stands out, the platform manager must feed the `TaskNodes` with fresh and relevant **Sources**. Without sources, AI tends to be generic; with sources, it becomes an up-to-date expert.

Here are 10 strategic ideas on where to look and what kind of sources to bring in to create viral videos on TikTok:

---

## 1. TikTok Creative Center (Official Trends)
- **Where:** [TikTok Creative Center - Trends](https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/popular/hashtag/pc/en)
- **What to look for:** Rising songs (Popular Songs) and hashtags that have grown more than 100% in the last 24 hours.
- **How to use as a source:** Copy the hashtag names and the description of why they are trending. Use them in the task so the AI adapts the script to that specific context.

## 2. Reddit "Curated Chaos" (High-Impact Subreddits)
- **Where:** Subreddits like `r/InterestingAsFuck`, `r/TodayILearned`, or `r/WhitePeopleTwitter`.
- **What to look for:** Posts with more than 10k upvotes in the last 12 hours. These are usually stories or facts that people love to share.
- **How to use as a source:** Copy the post text or the main comment thread. The task should be "Convert this Reddit thread into a 60-second script with an impactful hook."

## 3. AnswerThePublic (Search Intent)
- **Where:** [AnswerThePublic.com](https://answerthepublic.com/)
- **What to look for:** Enter a keyword for your niche (e.g., "Digital Marketing") and look for questions like "Why...", "How...", or "What is the best...".
- **How to use as a source:** Download the CSV of questions or copy the top 10 most searched ones. Use them as a source for the AI to create a series of "Q&A" videos that already have real demand.

## 4. Google Trends (Real-Time Interest Peaks)
- **Where:** [Google Trends - Realtime Search Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/trendingsearches/realtime)
- **What to look for:** News that is exploding right now in your country or category.
- **How to use as a source:** Copy the main news article. Ask the AI: "Analyze this trending news and generate a TikTok script that explains how this affects our audience."

## 5. Competitor Comments (Gold Mining)
- **Where:** Go to the profiles of the top 3 competitors on TikTok and check the comments of their most viral videos.
- **What to look for:** People asking things that weren't answered in the video, or common complaints ("I wish someone would explain X").
- **How to use as a source:** Copy and paste 20-30 comments into a text file. Use it as a source to create content that "solves what others ignored."

## 6. X (Twitter) "Meme Pulse"
- **Where:** Twitter's "Explore" section or accounts like `@Trendsmap`.
- **What to look for:** Educational threads or visual memes that are going viral.
- **How to use as a source:** Copy the content of a successful educational thread. TikTok loves "list" content (e.g., "5 tools that feel illegal to know"). The AI can structure the thread for the vertical format.

## 7. Pinterest Predicts (Aesthetic Trends)
- **Where:** [Pinterest Predicts](https://business.pinterest.com/en-us/pinterest-predicts/)
- **What to look for:** Quarterly reports on what will be trending in fashion, decor, or lifestyle.
- **How to use as a source:** Use the key concepts of the report (e.g., "Dopamine Decor") as a source. Ask the AI to create a script for "How to achieve trend X without spending money."

## 8. YouTube Shorts & Podcast Clips
- **Where:** Check the most-viewed clips from popular podcasts (e.g., Joe Rogan, Diary of a CEO, or local podcasts).
- **What to look for:** 30-second snippets that generate debate or curiosity.
- **How to use as a source:** Transcribe the audio from the clip (you can use fast transcription tools). Use the text as a source for the AI to create a "response" or a "summary" of that controversial opinion.

## 9. Amazon "Best Sellers" or "Movers & Shakers"
- **Where:** [Amazon Movers & Shakers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers)
- **What to look for:** Products that have riser dramatically in sales rank in the last 24 hours.
- **How to use as a source:** Copy the product name and features. Ask the AI: "Write a script for a 'TikTok Made Me Buy It' style video about this product, focusing on the problem it solves."

## 10. Niche Newsletters (Substack)
- **Where:** Subscribe to newsletters like *The Hustle*, *Morning Brew*, or industry-specific ones.
- **What to look for:** The "insight" or the curious statistic of the day that comes summarized in the email.
- **How to use as a source:** Paste the email content. Newsletters already do the curation work for you. The AI just has to convert that dense textual content into a visual and dynamic format for TikTok.

### Pro Tip for the Manager:
Remember that in **Control Markets**, you can connect multiple sources to a single `TaskNode`. Try combining **Source 4 (News)** with **Source 5 (Comments)** to create videos that not only inform but also respond exactly to what people are criticizing or asking.
